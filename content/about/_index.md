The American Cheese Society has recently named the best "Cheese Curds in America", and lo and behold they are available right here in the Grafton-Cedarburg-Mequon area. The Curd Nurd has been supplying "fresh cheese curds" to the North Shore area since September of 2012. Entrepreneur James Lightner a trained Gourmet Chef who has worked in the food service industry for over twenty years, started the "Curd Nurd" business after realizing that the people who live in the North Shore communities were deprived of the exhilarating experience of eating fresh cheese curds. "Having grown up in Northeast Wisconsin I have partaken in the heavenly experience of eating fresh curds since childhood. I have lived in the North Shore for several years and have craved those squeaky delicacies. One night my brothers and I were eating some fresh cheese curds in my home town of Oconto. I remarked that I could not find any fresh curds in the North Shore communities. My brother Michael remarked that I should bring fresh curds to the people of the North Shore and I could be the "Curd Nurd". "We laughed so hard but then we started to think about it and decided that bringing fresh curds to the people of the North Shore was a great idea.

Lightner established a relationship with Springside Cheese located in Spruce Wi just outside of the Oconto Falls/Lena area. The Curd Nurd delivers fresh curds several times a week and sells them out of the Curd Nurdmoblie that has quickly become the rave in the North Shore communities. Everyone honks and waves at the Curd Nurdmobile says Lightner. The Curd Nurdmobile is a white Chevy cargo van emblazoned with Curd Nurd phraseology including the hit slogan "Seek the Squeak", which refers to the sound that emanates from the chewing of a fresh curd.

The delicious, delectable cheese curds from Springside Cheese have been named the best Cheese Curds in America by the American Cheese Society. "Several months ago I investigated getting curds from a cheese factory closer to the North Shore so that my transportation costs would go down. My advisors and I tasted the curds from the closer cheese producer and could not in good faith dissappoint our customers who have become accustomed to the best cheese curds in the nation.". said Lightner.

Since starting up the "Curd Nurd", business last September, Lightner has become a celebrity a local events and festivals. He has become a staple at the Theinsville Farmers Market held every Tuesday. In addition he is stationed at Mike's Citgo in Grafton where he does a brisk and international business. Many customers have purchase the award winning curds for shipment overseas. Just recently a customer purchase over a hundred pounds of curds to give as gifts to guests attending a wedding reception. "When I started this business I just wanted to bring fresh curds to the people of the North Shore so that they might experience the taste and sound of the squeaky curd. But I soon discovered that many people are buying fresh curds to bring love to ones the care about. I never thought my curds would bring love, but I am glad they do, said Lightner.

What does the future bring for the Curd Nurd? According to Lightner, "We are planning to expand our business to the greater Milwaukee area. People are hungry for the award winning fresh curds from Springside Cheese. We are looking to expand into more convenience and grocery stores and are investigating a store front location. But regardless of where we go with the business we are committed to bringing fresh cheese curds from Springside Cheese to our friends of the North Shore.
